# Project1

This is a collection of projects done in advanced programming Fall 2019.


Project1.java
  This form will collect data from the user, and create a password based on their input. It will also give them fun facts about themselves and give them advice.
  The program should ask the user for the following:
  1.	First name
  2.	Last name
  3.	Gender
  4.	Birthday (MM/DD/YYYY)
  5.	Age
  6.	Phone number (XXX-XXX-XXXX)
  7.	GPA

  Once the input is stored in variables, the program should print all the information and create a password by concatenating the first character of every input. For example, 
  First name: Paydirt 
  Last name: Pete
  Gender: Toon Mascot
  Birthday: 02/20/2005
  Age: 14
  Phone number: 915-747-5000
  GPA: 3.0
  Password: PPT0193

  The program should calculate the users age in months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds and display it at the end. For this program, assume no leap years, that is, all years are 365 das long. The output should be formatted as a paragraph and appear like the following:
  Wow Pete! You are 14 years old, that is 168 months, or 730 weeks, or 5110 days, or 122640 hours, or 7358000 minutes, or 441500000 seconds!
